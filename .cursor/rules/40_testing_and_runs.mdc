# Testing and Execution

## Rules
- Unit tests for domain layer (pure functions)
- Integration tests for data adapters (with mocks)
- Scripts in `scripts/` for manual execution
- No new dependencies without updating `ai_docs/01_STATUS.md` "Dependencies" section

## Enforcement
- Run `pytest` before committing domain changes
- Keep tests fast and isolated
- Document script usage in README.md
