# Pure Engine Architecture

## Rule
Domain layer (`app/domain/*`) must remain deterministic:
- No network calls (no requests, no HTTP)
- No filesystem I/O (except via dependency injection)
- No LLM calls
- Pure functions only: inputs → outputs

## Enforcement
- All I/O happens in `app/data/*` (adapters) or `app/storage/*` (cache)
- Domain functions take data as parameters, return computed results
- Changes must be small and scoped; ask before cross-cutting refactors
